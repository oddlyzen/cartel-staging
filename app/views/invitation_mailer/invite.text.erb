Dear <%= @full_name %>,

You have been invited by <%= "#{@referrer.first_name} #{@referrer.last_name}" %>

We are very excited to finally have a beta of CARTEL for you to try out! You have been specially selected for this closed testing round, which is designed to get feedback on your needs and requests as an art world professional.

While you will be able to invite 5 other artists and professionals to join, please bear in mind the following:

1. The CARTEL website you have access to is not yet ready for public release! There may be things that don’t work very well at first, so please feel free to reach out to us and let us know what we can do better.

2. We are still growing! As you will be among a very small group of users, we do not have a lot of content yet- but we’d love to know what you care about and what you like to see on this website.

3. We are still building! CARTEL will not stop here. With more feedback, we will be able to build a product that you can use everyday!

Please let us know your thoughts by emailing <%= ENV['ADMIN_MAIL'] %> or using the contact links set up on the website.

Here is your link <%= @link %> to joining Cartel.

CARTEL (Contemporary Art Intel) is a professional platform for your art world needs. You will be able to manage your professional profile and portfolio, as well register a page for your organisation!

Thanks for trying CARTEL. We hope to hear from you soon!

Best wishes,
The CARTEL team
